\section{Measurement}
We used an electrical DC-motor and analysed the rpm by changing the voltage from $-13V$ to $13V$. With the measured rpm with the associated voltage we took an tangens in a linear phase of the curve. With this tangens we determine the plant transfer function in the laplace domain by calculating $\frac{T_{u}}{T_{g}}$. This we achieved by using the Hudzovic curves. With the transfer function we analysed the behavior of a P controller, PI controller and of the PID controller.
The best PID controller we obtained were optmized until an overshoot of $\leq 5 \%$ occured.
