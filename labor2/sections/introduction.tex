\section{Introduction}
Every engineer needs to have the knowledge of tuning and optimize a PID controller. He also needs to know the well proven rules of tuning a PID controller. Therefore the goal of this exercise is to apply the knowledge acquired to tuning a PID controller. Specially the tuning rules according to Ziegler-Nichols (oscillation method) and to Chien-Hrones-Reswick (step respibse method) are going to be used. Even if there are plenty of other tuning rules. The important two rules for this exercise will be the two mentioned before. This will be achieved by investigating an electrical motor and by optimizing the controllers parameters manually in closed loop. Furthermore the goal is to apply the knowledge to do a simulation in Matlab/Simulink.
