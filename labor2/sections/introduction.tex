\section{Introduction}

Every  engineer  needs  to  have  the knowledge of tuning and optimize  a  PID
controller.  He  also  needs  to know the well proven rules of  tuning  a  PID
controller. Therefore the  goal  of  this  exercise  is to apply the knowledge
acquired  to tuning a PID controller. Specially the tuning rules according  to
Ziegler-Nichols  (oscillation   method)   and  to  Chien-Hrones-Reswick  (step
respibse method) are going to be  used.  Even  if  there  are  plenty of other
tuning  rules.  The important two rules for this  exercise  will  be  the  two
mentioned before. This  will  be achieved by investigating an electrical motor
and  by  optimizing  the  controllers  parameters  manually  in  closed  loop.
Furthermore the goal  is  to  apply  the  knowledge  to  do  a  simulation  in
Matlab/Simulink.
