\section{Theory}

The  risk  of  instability in control circuits are caused by the delays. It is
always  necessary to ensure that a system is stable. There exist  some  simple
tuning rules (proposed by Ziegler-Nichols and Chien, Hrones and Reswick)  that
allow us to calculate stable  parameters  for  P,  PI,  and  PID  controllers.
